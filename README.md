### State
This repository isn't ready to use in production/prototyping, because is work in progress. When extension will be ready I'll update this README.md accordingly.

### Usage

1. First, you need to get the `godot-vosk-gdextension`. To do so, you can navigate to the releases tab or clone and build this repository by yourself.
2. Add the GDExtension to your project.
3. Enable Audio Input in `Project Settings -> Audio -> Driver -> Enable Input` (Advanced Settings).
4. Add `Record` bus by navigating to bottom section of the editor, then click the `Audio` tab and the `Add bus` button.
5. Under `Record` bus click the `Add Effect` button and select `Record` effect.
6. Add the `AudioStreamPlayer` node to your scene.
7. In the inspector (`AudioStreamPlayer`) as Stream select `new AudioStreamMicrophone`.
8. Enable `AudioStreamPlayer` autoplay and select `Record` as a Bus at the bottom of the inspector.
9. 


### Development
1. `cd godot-cpp`.
2. `python -m SCons`.
3. `cd ..`
4. `python -m Scons`.
5. Run `/demo/godot.project` in Godot.

signal vosk_recognizer_ready_signal(is_ready : bool, error_message : String)



# Methods

# init Vosk with path to model dir
vosk_voice_recognition.initVosk(p_model_path : String = "bin/models/...") -> void

# set Vosk log level
vosk_voice_recognition.setLogLevel(p_log_level : int) -> void

# set grammar json string
vosk_voice_recognition.setWordsJson(p_words_json : String = "[]") -> void

```


### Dependencies

This project is created around [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/). Vosk is a great speech recognition toolkit with support for 20+ languages. The best feature of Vosk is it's working offline..

### Models

Vosk models can be found on [Vosk website](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/). Check the [models list here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).


### Todo

-  ✔ Create GDExtension.
-  ✔ Load Vosk library.
-  ✔ Method to load models.
-  ✔ Add ability to provide word list for accuracy.
- 🚧 Get audio buffer to work with.
- 🚧 Pass audio converted audio buffer or convert it on the GDE side.
- ❌ Get partial text results.
