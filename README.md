```
# Available signals
signal vosk_ready_signal(is_ready : bool, error_message : String)
signal vosk_model_loaded_signal(model_path : String)
signal vosk_recognizer_ready_signal(is_ready : bool, error_message : String)

# Methods
vosk_voice_recognition.init(model_path : String = "bin/models/...") -> void # init Vosk with path to model dir
vosk_voice_recognition.setLogLevel(int log_level) -> void # set Vosk log level
...
```


### Dependencies

This project is created around [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/). Vosk is a great speech recognition toolkit with support for 20+ languages. The best feature of Vosk is it's working offline..

### Models

Vosk models can be found on [Vosk website](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/). Check the [models list here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).
